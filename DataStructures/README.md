# Data Structures

(This library is no longer being updated, check the C++ one instead)

Currently contains:

* Segment Trees (Lazy Propogation for range updates, queries O(log n), updates O(log n)
   * Minimum Segment Tree
   * Range Sum Segment Tree

* Union Find (Contains Path Compression + Union by Rank heuristics, Union O(αn), Find O(αn), amortized O(1)

* Binary Indexed Tree/Fenwick Tree (can go positive or negative), queries O(log n), updates O(log n), range updates O(n). Use BIT if you can because its slightly faster than segtree.

* Sparse Table (one indexed).
